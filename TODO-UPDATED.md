# Fix 404 Error for Login Endpoint - Implementation Plan

## âœ… Completed Steps

1. **âœ… Updated Vercel Configuration**: Fixed `vercel.json` to properly route API requests to Express server
2. **âœ… Verified API Entry Point**: Confirmed `api/index.ts` properly exports Express app
3. **âœ… Verified Server Configuration**: Confirmed `server/app.ts` has proper Express setup with auth routes
4. **âœ… Tested Build Process**: Build completed successfully without errors

## ðŸŽ¯ Root Cause Identified

The 404 error was caused by incorrect Vercel routing configuration. The original `vercel.json` was routing API requests to `api/index.js` but the Express server routes were not being properly exposed.

## ðŸ”§ Fix Applied

### Updated vercel.json
- Changed API routing from `api/index.js` to `/api/index.ts`
- Updated build configuration to use `@vercel/node` for API routes
- Fixed static asset routing for the frontend

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Vercel**: The configuration is now ready for deployment
2. **Test Authentication**: Verify login endpoint works correctly after deployment

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Checklist

- [x] Build process completes successfully
- [ ] Login endpoint returns 200 for valid credentials (admin/admin)
- [ ] Login endpoint returns 401 for invalid credentials
- [ ] All auth endpoints are accessible (/api/auth/me, /api/auth/logout)
- [ ] No 404 errors for API routes

## ðŸš€ Deployment Instructions

1. Push changes to your repository
2. Vercel will automatically deploy with the new configuration
3. Test the login functionality at the deployed URL
